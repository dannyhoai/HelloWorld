Outside the main characters door, an older male character knocks.
?: "I'm going to work now, Alex. Something's happened, and they need me."
Main Character: "Oh, yeah sure, Dad! I'll see you later!"
The main character's eyes lights up for a little bit as he talks to his father, but they quickly turn darkened again.

Alex is sitting in front of his computer, as it's recording a video message.
Alex: "Alright... What to say, what to say..."
Alex taps the side of his head slightly.
Alex: "This is to understand my motives, so I suppose, I should start with an explanation."
Alex: "Technology is amazing and has connected the world beyond imagining. The internet is a basic human right, but one which can and is misused."
Alex: "The people who misuse it, to cause havoc and chaos... I believe these people are toxic for the continuation of this beautiful technology."

Page 6:

Alex plays with an ink pen.
Alex: "Humanity wants an outlet...
...but if you let them in masses, have this outlet, it will destroy beautiful things."
Alex: "I don't believe anyone wants to do something about this.
 so I want to make certain that this behaviour is met with negativity."
Alex: "If I succeed, I should hope this video go down in history. If I fail, I suppose this is a confession. I don't mind that."

Page 7:

Alex clears his throat.
Alex: "Trolls."
Alex: "Verbal harassment."
We see Alex pulling up holographic files, of different footage, people yelling certain things inside games.
"FUCKING NOOB UNINSTALL AND DIE OF CANCER"
"YOU PIECE OF SHIT!"
Two players one warrior other mage/archer both have KDA over their head 0/3/0 something.
A girl standing in a webcam-esque setting wearing a sexy outfit with a guitar. One of the comments are enlarged, which she starts in a scared way at.
Comment: "THIS IS HILLARIOUS. 
I THINK I'LL SEND SCREENSHOTS TO YOUR PARENTS HOUSE."

Page 8:

Alex: "It could be minor things, such as intentionally helping the enemy to see their own team suffer..."
Alex: "Or cases where people are stalked, or mocked, pictures shared against their will... Lives ruined, because humanity wants relief of their stress. An outlet. I don't think this is fair."
Alex: "And so..."p 
The image begins to blurr.

Jessica: "Another one, exact same circumstances.. Was behaving badly in a game and his brain got fried."
The mother cries extra hysterically, at the relaxed way Jessica says his brain got fried.
Owen: "Maybe escort the mother somewhere else, thank you?"

Page 10:

Owen: "Who was he interacting with?"
They enter the boys room looking at his dead body.
Owen: "Urgh.. It stinks.."
Jessica: "We checked. None of the players on the server, had the same IP's as previous victims."
Owen: "So, tech guys, what's the status on the computer system?"
A nerdy-looking Technology Expert runs to Owen to explain it to him.

Tech Guy: "Looks exactly like the previous cases. The system has been fried with the boy, so we have no idea who caused it."
Owen: "How can this be done...?"

Page 11:

Patrick: "When you log into the internet, your mind becomes like data."
Illustration showing this.
Patrick: "Data in turn, can be corrupted and removed by the system."
Patrick: "It seems that the hacker corrupts their data and fries the equipment along with their brains. Because of this, we have no idea who causes it."
Owen: "Bastard..."

Page 12-13

The main character Alex, stands in a black room inside the internet, as he raises his hands a holographic keyboard comes up.
Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVRnMrl2oj8
Alex smiles happily, as he sees various games being played and social media occuring.

Alex: "Who is it today, who is it today, who is it today..."
Alex brings up a file of a disgusting fat man and various censored pictures of girls.
His name: "Bill Johnson"
His age: "34"
His occupation: "Currently on wellfare"
http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/168/6/c/1300422688172_by_hoai93-d7mr1h1.jpg
Alex: "Pretends to be a young boy, lures little girls into sending him pictures, and when they start being suspicious, he tells them that he'll spread the pictures on the internet..."
Alex presses a few buttons on the keyboard.
Alex: "Dead."

Bill Johnson's apartment.]
Owen: "Another one? Urgh it stinks even worse in here..."
Jessica: "This man was blackmailing young girls into sending him naked pictures."
Owen: "Might have been better dead, then..."
Patrick: "Sir?"
Owen: "I mean, he should have still gone to the police with this information if he had it, but still... Rather dead, than giving him free prison food.."

Alex is now playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, as he is dancing around the virtual space.
Alex: "Who is next...?"
Alex brings up five files, with 5 different people.
Alex: "Sending threats to a female player and her family, after she rejected you?"
Alex: "Dead."
Alex: "Pretending to be a girl, to lure people to pay you money, for flight tickets in return for sex?"
Alex: "Dead."
Alex: "Bragging about a video you made, throwing kittens into rivers?"
Alex: "Dead."

Alex: "And now, the FINALE!"
Turns around dramatically, to the classical music playing behind him, as he closes his eyes with his arms stretched into a waltz.
Alex turns around and pulls up a file.
Name: Morris Morton

Occupation: Poet
Alex: "Minor celebrity who commissions rape porn videos of school girls getting strangled, for his own private amusement~~?"

Cute TV Anchor: "Having brought light to four political scandals in these last months, as well as exposing acts by poet Morris Morton, having paid for the creation of rape porn depicting underage children, the internet killer has inspired many recent debates, including..."
Alex' father Owen turns off the television.
Owen: "Urgh.."

A guy is sitting on a chair with a pocky in his mouth and in hand a manga with a cover of one of Reon's manga. Posters of moe girls (eudetenis drawings if she likes) all around him, yet the office is very professional, and he is wearing a suit.

Danny has short white hair, and with a constantly happy expression. You can't see his eyes due to the black tinted reading glasses. He wears a vest, shirt, and necktie, but no blazer.
[Danny Wulff
Age: 21
Chief of Virtual Crime Department]
An very cute office Lady, with a serious facial expression, is standing in front of him. Medium boobs. Good curves.
http://www.goodwp.com/large/201105/18241.jpg
(Black hair, no curls, normal-length hair.)
Danny: "Yes?"
Office Lady: "Detective Anderson is here to see you, Mister Wulff."

Page 20

Danny: "Oh?"
Owen walks in, as Danny closes his manga.
Danny: "Oooooh myyyy, Detective Anderson! I don't see you much here in the IT palace, much~!! What brings you here?"
Owen: "Do people still read books on dead tree?"
Danny: "These? These are Manga. Have been in my family for quite a long time, you see."
Owen: "Huh. Well let me explain, why I'm here."

Page 21:

Danny: "Oh, I know! You've been working on that internet killer case and up until now, we've had nothing to do with it, since nobody has been able to find anything on him."
Owen: "Precisely, but..."
Danny: "But now you're here, because something is different, obviously. Did some of the data survive?"
Owen: "Yes."
Office Lady: "Give it to me."
The Office Lady is handed a futuristic USB file, which she walks over to the desk of Danny Wulff with.
Danny: "I've been wanting to get involved with this for quite some time, Mister Anderson! Quite some time!"
Owen: "Well, now you got your chance, don't you?"
Danny smirks.

Page 22

As the Office Lady inserts the file into a futuristic computer sitting on his desk, files appear holographically on it.

We see them in the reflection of Danny Wulffs glasses.
Danny: "Oooh... Interesting..."
Danny: "Miss Wilson, get me a cup of cocoa, will you?"
Office Lady: "Get it yourself."
Danny: "Waaah, so cold you are!"
She walks past Owen, who raises his eyebrow in confusion.

Page 25

Danny: "That's why I hired her..."
Danny whispers with a happy smile. We can't see his eyes, as he wears black-tinted reading glasses.
Owen: "Hum..."
Danny: "But this data is interesting..."
Danny: "Very interesting..."

[iSocial - Social Game]

We see a colourful social game, with a lot of different characters all wearing different sexy, or punky outfits, as expected of a 3D social game.
We see a weird man, pressing a girl against a younger girl.
Man: "You logged on as I said. Good."
Girl: "Please don't... This game server is weird..."
Man: "Do you want me to send those pictures around your school?"
Girl: "..."
Man: "Come on, let's go into a private room, and..."
The girl is almost crying.
The main character briefly appears behind the man, in the flash of the moment.
Alex: "Scum."
Man: "Huh?"
The man get's electrocuted and in real life he falls onto his keyboard, his screen showing a blue error screen. White text, and a skull showing ERROR beneath.

Page 27

Danny Wulff is drinking cocoa with marshmallows as he smiles amusedly.
Danny: "He's getting to emotional, Mister Anderson."
Danny: "He's using a Virtual Private Network or VPN, from a company on Earth."
Owen: "What do you mean?"
Danny: "A VPN is used for stuff like making a tunnel connection between two places. Look here, he has a three layered tunnel connection, when exchanging information."
A chibi head of Danny with wolf ears down left and then technical drawings of two PC screens with two parallel lines connecting them.


Danny: "So I think, we can extract his IP address."
Danny raises his arms comedically.
Page 28

Danny smashes his hands down on the virtual keyboard, still with an open-mouth smile on his face.
Danny: "Let's see what you can do, Internet Killer."
Danny and Alex stare at each other in a virtual space.
Danny: "Who are you? Who could do something like that?"
Alex: "..."

Page 28

Danny is looking at Owen and puts a pocky in his mouth.
Danny: "I'm trying to hack through the tunnel and get his IP."
Danny: "It's pretty easy to detect, but he'll know I'm trying to detect it, so we're going to try something else."
Owen: "What?"
Owen pulls out a very old laptop onto his desk from a box behind him, which he blows dust off.
Owen: "It's easier to detect with an outdated, even ancient system."

Page 29

He opens the laptop and turns it on.
Danny and Alex stare at each other in the black symbolic space, Danny is now holding up the ancient laptop.
Danny: "Please be a challenge."

[Two Hours Later...]
It's raining outside from the artificial atmosphere. Owen is drinking some coffee and looking outside it.
The office lady joins him in looking outside the Window, while Danny is in his office working.
On the window in a small delicate corner it says "2 Hours till rain stops. Thank you for your patience."
Office Lady: "He'll be done soon."
Owen: "He's not a very usual sort of guy... I guess tech people never are, are they?"
Office Lady: "He's a rude idiot, but he's a genius with this sort of thing."
Owen smiles in a fatherly way.
Owen: "My son loves computers. He's not quite as weird as Mister Wulff though."
Danny's face appears on the window.
Danny: "It's done!"

Page 32

Danny: "Here's the IP of our guy! We need to send some people over to him as fast as possible or he'll slip away."
Owen: "Wait a minute... That IP is..."
[Anderson Residence]
Police escort out a boy with handcuffs, and a jacket over his head, as the media take pictures.

Page 33
Police interogration room
Owen sits down in front of his son, who smiles at him.
Owen stares angrily and depressedly at his son.
Owen: "Why?"
Alex: "Because... Well, I made a video... Can't you check that out?"
Owen assaults Alex, hitting him in the face, as he jumps over the table. A police officer tries to grab him.

Page 33

Danny: "That wasn't even a challenge... A shame..."
Office Lady: "Here's your cocoa, Mister Wulff."
Danny: "... No marshmallows?"
Office Lady: "Get them yourself, idiot!"
Danny: "Wonderful tsundere reaction! That's why I hired you!"
Danny thumbs up.
Office lady hits his head lightly from above.

Page 35

The nervous girl who was being harassed by a guy, is now playing iSocial on her own.
Another girl: "I thought you said this game was full of creepy weirdo's... This seems pretty nice, though?"
Girl: "Yeah... For some reason it feels better to play."

Page 36

Danny sits down in front of Alex, whose beaten to a pulp by his father.
Danny smiles at him.
Alex looks tiredly at him.
Alex: "You're the guy who caught me, right?"
Danny just continues smiling.
Alex: "You want to know why I did it?"
Danny tilts his head. The office lady stands next to him holding his cocoa with marshmallow. On the cup theres doge.

Page 36

Alex: "I did it to make everything better. At least for a little bit."
Danny: "You'll be put in a psychiatric hospital."
Alex: "What?!"
Danny get's up, and turns around.
Alex: "But I'm not mentally ill!"
Danny: "Oh, it'll be nice. They have fingerpainting, I hear."
Danny: "... You know, I hoped you were a bit better than that."
Alex get's furious.
Alex: "You bastard!!"

Page 38-39

Danny sits in his office.
Danny takes off his glasses, revealing Wolf-like demon eyes.
Danny sighs.

The main character is put inside his psychiatric ward cell.
There's an old computer inside and a stack of games on the desktop(Diblio 42, warstuff 3, starstuff 2).
He looks at it with a neutral expression.
